Actual Code of the project.
Here is the documentation of the code:


The intent of the README.md is :
“You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. “

1.	The run_analysis.R code has 16 steps in all – Step 0 thru Step 15.
2.	The goals of the project are achieved as outlined in A – E
3.	The goals are clearly stated in the header section of the code as part of main documentation.
4.	The 17 steps are spread in  the codebase. 
5.	The data source and descriptions  for the project data are:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

  The Goals and Steps are listed below:
I.	Goals.
A:Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
 Step 13:Result of merged data set for Test and Train data.
B:Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 Step 5:Mean & Std Dev mesaures extraction for Test Data. 
Step 9:Mean & Std Dev mesaures extraction for Train Data.
C:Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 6:Test data descriptive activity names
Step 11 :Train data descriptive activity names
D:Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Step 14: Implemented via the idenity_labels variable.
E:From the data set in step 4,creates a second, independent tidy data set 
 with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  Step 15: A tidy data set (tidy_data) with  mean /average is created.

II.	The 17 steps in the code are listed below:

  Step 0: Housekeeping  - cleanup your working directory, make sure data.table,reshape2 packages are installed
Step 1: Define the packages and libraries that are required upfront.
 Step 2: Store the Activity labels("WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" etc) 
         in a variable.This is for the data to be importted in step3 and step8 
Step 3 :Import & Load the X, y and subject test data sets into tables.
tep 4: extract the text  "mean" &  "std" (for standard deviation) of the measurements using grepl 
  to create a logical vector. TRUE value for id, mean and stddev cols and FALSE for other columns
Step 5: extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Step 6 Load the Activity labels, assign the labels and subject to the dataset. 
Step 7: Bind the test dataset
Step 8: Process the Train data sets for X,y and subject.
Step 9: extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Step 11 Load the Activity labels, assign the labels and subject to the dataset.
Step 12: Bind the train dataset
Step 13 : Now merge the test and train data post the two cbind's
    and clean up the variable names
Step 14 : Now apply the labels to the cols and data to the merged data set
Step 15 : Now apply the mean function to the melt dataset using the dcast function to create a tidy dataset
Step 16 : Save/Write the tidy data set to a file
